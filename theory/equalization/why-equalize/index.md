### Why would I want to equalize?

The purpose of equalization is to correct the sound signature that is natively put out by given headphones. Correction means emphasizing or de-emphasizing certain frequencies in the audio spectrum to even out inconsistencies, subdue piercing high tones, elevate weak bass, and so on. Unfortunately, proper equalization is difficult, and it can do more harm than good if applied unskillfully and without prior measurements.
