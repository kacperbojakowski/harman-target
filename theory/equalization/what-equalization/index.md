### What is equalization?

Equalization is the process of adjusting volumes of different frequency bands in the audio signal to reach a desired tonality. This can be achieved via hardware- or software-based procedures. Most computer music players include simple equalization options, such as bass boost or a graphic equalizer with adjustable bands for certain pre-set frequencies. However, external apps and drivers tend to offer more options and better sound quality.
