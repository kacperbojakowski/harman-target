### Why don't manufacturers produce already equalized heaphones?

They probably would if they could â€“ if only it were that simple. There's a host of subtleties and variables that go into making a pair of headphones. Realistically, engineers can't ensure that the end-product will reflect their intentions verbatim. This is where equalization comes into play: it allows you to smooth out imperfections and, in the end, get you more worth for your money.
