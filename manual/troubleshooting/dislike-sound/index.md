### I have set it all right, but I don't like the way it sounds.

That's OK! Sound signature is something subjective. Some people just don't like the Harman curve. You can experiment with the settings until they suit your tastes, find presets for different targets (e.g. the diffuse field), or simply give up equalization completely. Don't feel pressured to improve something you enjoy as it is.
