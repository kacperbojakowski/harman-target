### The volume is lower when I turn on the equalization.

This is completetly natural. Ideally, equalization should not emphasize a certain frequency directly, but rather de-emphasize frequencies around it. In this way, the targeted frequency is raised only relatively to the rest of the spectrum, thus preventing distortion from too much gain. Negative preamp values defined in the presets ensure that any boost in frequency is still, in fact, a decrease. This results in lower overall volume, which you can then turn up as needed.
