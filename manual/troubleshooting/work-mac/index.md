### How can I make this work on a Mac?

You can't, unless you use some sort of Windows virtualization. Equalizer APO is not supported on macOS. With that said, you may still be able to find a workable substitute. First off, check out this list of equalizers. Opt for anything with a 10-band GUI, fully adjustable frequency for each band, preamp gain control, and filters with Q-factor/ bandwidth regulation. Then, in the app of your choice, try to set everything as to mirror oratory1990's settings for a given preset.
