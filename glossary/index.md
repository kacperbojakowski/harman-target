# Glossary

Here is a list of technical terms and abbreviations (in parentheses) that appear in this document.

**Acoustic adaptation** – the process of optimizing an area for the best listening experience by using special panels and other fittings that diffuse or absorb certain frequencies.  
**Bass** – low-register sounds in the audible spectrum, responsible for the depth and "the oomph" in a song, corresponding with instruments such as drums; generally below 250hz.  
**Bandwidth (BW)** – the width of frequencies a filter affects; the same as q-factor, but expressed in different numbers (mutually convertible).  
**Digital-to-analog converted (DAC)** – a separate device or a module in a sound interface, responsible for converting digital signal to analog signal and vice versa.  
**Driver** – an interface for running and managing specific pieces of hardware or low-level software procedures.  
**Equalization (EQ)** – the process of adjusting volume levels of specific frequencies in the signal to correct or change it towards a desired sound signature.  
**Filter** – a device or function (in software) that supresses, amplifies, or removes a certain frequency range from the signal.  
**Frequency response** – the quantitative measure of the sound spectrum a device puts out; also: a mental shortcut for "sound signature".  
**Gain** – the measure of the increase in power or amplitude of a signal.  
**Graphical user interface (GUI)** – a graphical interface that allows users to communicate with a device or software.  
**Output** – the signal a device puts out; also: in hardware, a physical location (e.g. a jack port) where the sound is put out.  
**Preamplifier** – also known as a pream; a device that amplifies a signal before it is sent for further processing.  
**Q-Factor** – the width of frequencies a filter affects; the same as bandwidth, but expressed in different numbers (mutually convertible).  
**Sound card** – internal or external expansion card responsible for sound processing in a computer; consists of a few different components, such as a DAC, a headphone amp, etc.  
**Sound pressure level (SPL)** – the amount of pressure a sound causes relative to ambient atmospheric pressure, measured in decibels (dB); perceived as loudness, i.e. the level of volume.  
**Sound signature** – the perceived character of sound put out by a piece of audio gear; strongly dependent on, but not limited to, the frequency response curve.  
**Target curve** – the shape of the curve (as represented on a frequency response graph) a given sound-outputting device is intended to produce in measurements.  
**Tonality** – the character of a piece of music, determined by the arrangement of sounds, the instruments used, etc.; also: a mental shortcut for "sound signature".  
**Treble** – high-register sounds in the audible spectrum, responsible for clarity, sharpness, and "the spark" in a song, corresponding with instruments such as flutes or cymbals; generally above 2000hz.
